    Ruby:  `$ brew install ruby`
    RVM: `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`    
3. Install rbenv ...
    `$ brew install rbenv`
   ... and then set up rbenv in your shell:
    `$ rbenv init`
4. Close your terminal, and then open a new terminal to make sure that your changes have taken effect.
5. Set your Ruby version to 2.3.0:
    `$ rvm --default use 2.3.0`
